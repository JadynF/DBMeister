# Introduction

## What is DBMeister

DBMeister is a webapp diagram tool used to help visualize database schemas for developers.

## Features and Benefits

Our main feature is a canvas page that allows users to drag and drop components onto a canvas to design their projects schema. We also allow these schemas to represent external connections to allow teams to see everything involved with their data. On top of this, there are many team-based features that support developers working as a group, such as group functionality, group chat, real-time diagram updates, and more!

This will benefit the development team substantially by simplifying the project schema down to a more understandable level. Making things such as onboarding, presenting to managers or clients, or troubleshooting the product much more simple.

## Target Audience

Any development team working with data, that needs to have a way to effectively represent their project.
